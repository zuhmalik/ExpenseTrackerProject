Expense Tracker Project
The "Expense Tracker Project" is a Java application that assists users in managing their expenses, tracking spending habits, and gaining insights into their financial activities. This project provides a command-line interface for adding, generating reports, and deleting expenses while storing the data in a MySQL database.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
MySQL database server set up with a database named expense_tracker.
MySQL Connector/J added to your project classpath.
How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ).
Build the project.
Run the ExpenseTracker class.

Features
1. Add Expense
The application allows users to add expenses by specifying the date, amount, category, and description. Expenses are then stored in the database for future reference.

2. Generate Report
Users can generate an expense report displaying all stored expenses. The report includes expense details such as ID, date, amount, category, and description. The total amount of expenses is also displayed at the end.

3. Delete Expense
Users can delete specific expenses by providing the corresponding expense ID. If the provided ID matches an existing expense, it will be deleted from the database.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

ExpenseTracker: The main class that orchestrates the application's functionality.
DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_URL: Constants for database connection configuration.
createTable(Connection connection): Method to create the expenses table if it does not exist.
displayMenu(Connection connection): Method to display the main menu and handle user interactions.
addExpense(Connection connection, Scanner scanner): Method to add a new expense to the database.
generateReport(Connection connection): Method to generate and display the expense report.
deleteExpense(Connection connection, Scanner scanner): Method to delete an expense from the database.

Future Enhancements
Enhance the user interface with a more user-friendly text-based menu.
Implement data validation for user inputs to prevent errors.
Introduce user authentication for secure access to expense data.

Notice:
- In order to use the logging capabilities provided by the default
  implementation com.mysql.cj.log.Slf4JLogger, it is required to add one or
  more jars for Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) to your CLASSPATH.
- To use the X DevAPI features in Connector/J, you also need the external
  library protobuf-java, which you can download manually from the official
  Maven repository and add it to the CLASSPATH, or use Maven's automatic
  dependency resolution features by adding a dependency to "GroupId: com.mysql"
  and "ArtifactId: mysql-connector-j" to your project's pom.xml file.
- To use OCI AIM authentication, you will need to add the external library
  oci-java-sdk-common, which you can download manually from the official Maven
  repository and add it to the CLASSPATH, or use Maven's automatic dependency
  resolution features by adding a dependency to "GroupId: com.oracle.oci.sdk"
  and "ArtifactId: oci-java-sdk-common" to your project's pom.xml file.
